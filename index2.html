		<p>The way we met was actually a happy accident. I had not changed my location settings or my age settings from the default, so Matt kind of snuck in there, because there's a 13-year age difference and we lived 50 miles apart. So we got a match, but neither of us was really taking it seriously. Matt messaged me, and we talked a little bit, and just kind of got everything big, all of our baggage, out right away so we could see if it was even worth continuing to talk. I gave him my phone number and he texted me, "Hi, Hannah, it's Matt." And I said: "Which Matt?" as a joke. And that was it. We just talked nonstop from that point, and we went on our first date a week later. We went on a hike, and we put wine in water bottles and had a little picnic at the end of the hike.

		Neither of us was looking for anything super-serious, but we kept hanging out regularly and it just kind of happened without either of us noticing. I have a son from a previous relationship — Jackson, he was 2 at the time — and they met and just really hit it off. I knew from the first date that I really, really liked Matt. It was great, because I couldn't get out a lot at the time — I could get out maybe once a week, if I had a babysitter. And you're not going to meet somebody at a bar if you're a single mom. So it saved me from meeting a lot of duds.

		Five months into dating, he proposed, but we had already been talking about it for a few months. He had met my son, so we had to ask: Do we have a future? Is it worth dating and building a relationship with Jackson? We decided it was worth it, obviously.I'm grateful. I don't know what I did to deserve this, but I'm just going with it. - Hannah Graber (25) and Matt Graber  <a href = "success.html" class="class1"><font size = "5px"><em><strong><p>Click here See more succes dating stories..</strong><em><font></a></p>
